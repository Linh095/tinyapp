# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). Users must register in order to creat new short URLs and view other users' short URLs. Once registered and logged in, each user will have their own library of short URLs corresponding to original long URLs. They will also be able to track how many other Tiny app users have visted their short URL and the total number of visits.
